polynomial.c
In this function, we write a polynomial to approximate e, given by the sum_{n=0}^{n=inf} x^n/n!


To compile write "gcc -o poly polynomial.c -lm" where lm includes the math library



mem_alloc.c
In this function we write an assign an array one ones using dynamic memory allocation with pointers.
