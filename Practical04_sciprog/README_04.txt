In this practial, we calculate the valuhes of tan(x) in radians from 0 to 60 degrees in steps of 5, printing the final array and making it a global variable.

trapezodialv2/3.c
In v2, we write our trapezoidal rule in the main part of the function. In v3, we write it as a seperate function and call it in main. 

To compile write "gcc -o trapezoidal_v2 trapezoidal_v2.c - lm" lm includes math library provided #include <math.h> is included.
