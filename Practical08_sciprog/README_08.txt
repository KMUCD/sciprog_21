gcd.c
In this function we use Euclid's algorithm ,adapted from scanning.c to calculate the gcd of a value iteratively and recursively. 

To compile, write "gcc -o gcd gcd.c"

In the Solution subdirectory for gcd_v2.c, gcd_v3.c and gcd_v4.c we include
- randomising arrays
- timing arrays
- arrays using file inputs

and compile the same way.
