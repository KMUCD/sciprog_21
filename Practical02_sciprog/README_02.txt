In this practical, we will complete the sum

Conversion.c
In this we compare the differences of floating pt and integer presentations


To compile we write "gcc -o Coversion_c Conversion.c"


Sum.c
Sum 1/n from n = 1 to n = 1000.
We compare the sums from i = 1 to 1000 and from i = 1000 to 1.
To compile we write  "gcc -o Sum_c Sum.c"
